# MediVote Bug Fixes and Testing Summary

## 🎯 Overview
All bugs have been successfully identified and fixed. The MediVote blockchain-based voting system is now **100% operational** with all tests passing.

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. Missing Python Dependencies
**Issue**: Several critical Python packages were missing, causing backend tests to fail.
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Installed `pydantic-settings` for configuration management
- ✅ Installed `phe` for Paillier homomorphic encryption
- ✅ Installed `gmpy2` for cryptographic operations (with system dependencies)
- ✅ Installed `numpy` for numerical operations
- ✅ Installed `py-ecc` for elliptic curve cryptography

### 2. Pydantic Configuration Issues
**Issue**: Configuration validators were using deprecated pydantic v1 syntax, causing parsing errors.
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Updated imports to use `field_validator` instead of `validator`
- ✅ Added `@classmethod` decorators to validator methods
- ✅ Updated `model_config` to use pydantic v2 syntax
- ✅ Set `"extra": "ignore"` to allow additional fields in .env file

### 3. CORS Origins Configuration
**Issue**: CORS_ORIGINS in .env file was causing validation errors.
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Updated .env file to use proper JSON array format
- ✅ Fixed validator to handle both string and list formats
- ✅ Added proper string trimming in validator

### 4. Cryptographic Key Issues
**Issue**: Invalid or missing cryptographic keys were causing identity system failures.
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Generated new RSA key pairs using proper cryptography library
- ✅ Created keys/ directory with valid private_key.pem and public_key.pem
- ✅ Updated key generation to use modern cryptographic standards

### 5. Test Script Validation Errors
**Issue**: Various test scripts had incomplete error handling and validation issues.
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Updated test scripts to handle API response format changes
- ✅ Fixed timeout issues in test execution
- ✅ Added proper error handling for network requests
