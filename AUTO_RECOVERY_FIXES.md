# MediVote Service Manager - Auto-Recovery Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ **Ctrl+C Graceful Shutdown**
**Problem**: Ctrl+C (SIGINT) wasn't disabling auto-recovery, causing services to restart during shutdown.

**Solution**: Updated signal handler to:
- Disable auto-recovery for all services when Ctrl+C is pressed
- Set `_shutdown_requested` flag to trigger graceful shutdown
- Prevents services from restarting during shutdown sequence

```python
def signal_handler(signum, frame):
    print(f"\nSTOP: Received signal {signum}, initiating graceful shutdown...")
    # Disable auto-recovery for all services to prevent restart during shutdown
    print("Disabling auto-recovery for all services...")
    for service_id in manager.service_configs:
        manager.auto_recovery_enabled[service_id] = False
    # Mark shutdown as requested
    manager._shutdown_requested = True
```

### 2. ✅ **Auto-Recovery Default State**
**Problem**: Auto-recovery was enabled in code but UI showed it as OFF initially.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `auto_recovery_enabled` to `True` in all service configurations
- Updated dashboard HTML to show button as "Auto-Recovery: ON" with `enabled` class
- Now UI matches actual state on startup

### 3. ✅ **Stop Button Bypasses Auto-Recovery**
**Problem**: Stopping a service would trigger auto-recovery to restart it immediately.

**Solution**: Modified `_stop_service_impl` to:
- Temporarily disable auto-recovery when Stop button is clicked
- Prevent the service from being restarted by health monitor
- Auto-recovery remains disabled after successful stop (user must re-enable if desired)

## Testing

1. **Test Ctrl+C Shutdown**:
   - Start all services
   - Press Ctrl+C
   - All services should stop without restarting

2. **Test Auto-Recovery UI**:
   - Start service manager
   - All buttons should show "Auto-Recovery: ON" initially
   - Toggle works to disable/enable

3. **Test Stop Button**:
   - Click Stop on any service
   - Service should stop and stay stopped
   - Auto-recovery won't restart it

## Result

- **Better Shutdown**: Ctrl+C properly stops all services
- **Consistent UI**: Auto-recovery state matches actual behavior
- **User Control**: Stop button gives explicit control over services
