# üéÅ MediVote Node Incentive System Guide

## Overview

The **Node Incentive System** is a clever mechanism that encourages users to run blockchain nodes by granting them **ballot creation privileges**. Users can only create ballots if they're running a node, with sophisticated mechanisms to prevent abuse and encourage long-term participation.

## üéØ Core Concept

### The Problem
- Users want to create ballots for voting
- Running nodes requires resources and commitment
- Without incentives, few users would run nodes
- Network would remain centralized and weak

### The Solution
- **Ballot Creation Privilege**: Only node operators can create ballots
- **Reputation System**: Rewards good behavior, penalizes abuse
- **Continuous Verification**: Ensures nodes are actually running
- **Uptime Requirements**: Ensures commitment to the network

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Components

1. **Incentive System** (`node_incentive_system.py`)
   - Manages node registration and verification
   - Handles ballot creation requests
   - Maintains reputation scores
   - Enforces system rules

2. **Frontend Integration** (`frontend/incentive_integration.js`)
   - User-friendly interface
   - Real-time status updates
   - Seamless ballot creation process

3. **Blockchain Node** (`blockchain_node.py`)
   - Participates in the network
   - Processes voting transactions
   - Provides verification endpoints

## üîê Security Mechanisms

### 1. **Node Verification**
```python
# System verifies nodes are actually running
async def _verify_node_running(self, address: str, port: int) -> bool:
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"http://{address}:{port}/status") as response:
                return response.status == 200
    except Exception:
        return False
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents fake node registration
- Ensures continuous operation
- Detects node disconnection

### 2. **Reputation System**
```python
# Reputation scoring
reputation_score: float = 100.0  # Start with 100 points
penalty_for_disconnect: float = 10.0  # Lose 10 points for disconnection
bonus_for_uptime: float = 5.0  # Gain 5 points for uptime
bonus_for_ballots: float = 2.0  # Gain 2 points for ballot creation
```

**Reputation Rules:**
- **Minimum Score**: 50 points required for ballot creation
- **Maximum Score**: 1000 points (encourages long-term participation)
- **Decay Rate**: Inactive nodes lose reputation over time
- **Recovery**: Active nodes regain reputation

### 3. **Ballot Limits**
```python
max_ballots_per_node: int = 10  # Each node can create 10 ballots
```

**Prevents:**
- Ballot spam
- Resource abuse
- Network flooding

### 4. **Uptime Requirements**
```python
min_uptime_hours: int = 24  # Must run for 24 hours minimum
```

**Ensures:**
- Commitment to the network
- Prevents quick abuse
- Rewards long-term participation

## üöÄ How It Works

### Step 1: Node Registration
```javascript
// User registers their node
const response = await fetch('/api/register-node', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        node_id: "node_abc123",
        public_key: "pk_xyz789",
        node_address: "localhost",
        node_port: 8545
    })
});
```

**System Verifies:**
- Node is actually running
- Node responds to status requests
- Node has valid configuration

### Step 2: Continuous Verification
```python
# Background task verifies nodes every 5 minutes
async def _background_verification(self):
    while self.is_running:
        for credential in self.node_credentials.values():
            is_running = await self._verify_node_running(
                credential.node_address, credential.node_port
            )
            
            if is_running:
                credential.reputation_score += 0.1  # Small boost
            else:
                credential.reputation_score -= 10.0  # Penalty
```

### Step 3: Ballot Creation Request
```javascript
// User requests to create a ballot
const response = await fetch('/api/request-ballot', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        node_id: "node_abc123",
        ballot_data: {
            title: "Presidential Election 2024",
            description: "Vote for the next president",
            candidates: ["Candidate A", "Candidate B", "Candidate C"],
            start_date: "2024-11-05T08:00:00",
            end_date: "2024-11-05T20:00:00"
        }
    })
});
```

**System Checks:**
- Node is currently running
- Minimum uptime requirement met
- Sufficient reputation score
- Ballot limit not exceeded

### Step 4: Reputation Management
```python
# Reputation increases for good behavior
if credential.is_active:
    credential.reputation_score = min(
        credential.reputation_score + self.config["reputation"]["bonus_for_uptime"],
        self.config["reputation"]["max_score"]
    )

# Reputation decreases for bad behavior
if not credential.is_active:
    credential.reputation_score = max(
        credential.reputation_score - self.config["reputation"]["penalty_for_disconnect"],
        self.config["reputation"]["min_score"]
    )
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Abuse Prevention

### 1. **Fake Node Prevention**
- System verifies nodes are actually running
- Checks node status endpoints
- Prevents registration of non-existent nodes

### 2. **Quick Disconnect Prevention**
- Continuous verification every 5 minutes
- Immediate detection of node disconnection
- Ballot creation blocked when node is offline

### 3. **Ballot Spam Prevention**
- Maximum 10 ballots per node
- Requires minimum 24 hours uptime
- Reputation requirements

### 4. **Sybil Attack Prevention**
- Each node must be unique
- Node verification prevents duplicates
- Reputation system discourages multiple fake nodes

## üìä Incentive Statistics

### Example Network Growth
```
Week 1: 1 node, 2 ballots created
Week 2: 3 nodes, 8 ballots created  
Week 3: 7 nodes, 15 ballots created
Week 4: 12 nodes, 25 ballots created
```

### Reputation Distribution
```
Excellent (800-1000): 20% of nodes
Good (600-799): 35% of nodes
Average (400-599): 30% of nodes
Poor (200-399): 10% of nodes
Blocked (50-199): 5% of nodes
```
