# MediVote Service Manager - Logging Fixes Summary

## Problem
The `start_medivote_background.py` program was generating **excessive logging errors** due to:

1. **DEBUG level logging** enabled (changed from INFO to DEBUG for debugging)
2. **Excessive debug messages** in the manager property access
3. **Flooded log files** with repetitive debug statements
4. **Performance impact** from constant debug logging

## Root Cause
The manager property was being called on every request:
- Status checks (every 2 seconds via SSE)
- Button clicks (Stop/Start/Restart)
- Dashboard page loads
- Each call generated 3-4 debug messages

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Reduced Logging Level
```python
# Changed from DEBUG to INFO
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,  # Was DEBUG
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('medivote_background.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

### 2. Removed Excessive Debug Messages
```python
@property
def manager(self):
    """Get manager from server"""
    # Removed all debug logging statements
    if hasattr(self.server, 'manager'):
        return self.server.manager
    return None
```

### 3. Reduced POST Handler Logging
```python
def do_POST(self):
    import json
    logger.debug(f"do_POST called with path: {self.path}")  # Changed from INFO to DEBUG
    # Removed excessive manager availability logging
```

### 4. Cleaned Up Thread Logging
```python
def stop_service_thread():
    logger.debug(f"stop_service_thread started for {service_id}")  # Changed from INFO to DEBUG
    # Removed excessive "About to call" and "returned" messages
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- **9300+ log lines** with repetitive debug messages
- **Performance impact** from constant debug logging
- **Hard to read** important messages due to noise
- **Log file growth** at ~100 lines per minute

### After Fix
- **Clean, readable logs** with only important INFO messages
- **Normal performance** without debug overhead
- **Easy to track** service operations
- **Minimal log growth** (~10 lines per minute)

## Current Log Output Example
