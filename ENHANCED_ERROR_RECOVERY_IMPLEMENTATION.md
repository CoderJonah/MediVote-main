# High Priority 3 Implementation: Enhanced Error Recovery and Resilience

## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Enterprise-Grade Error Recovery**

### **‚úÖ Problem Solved**

**Issue**: MediVote Service Manager lacked comprehensive error recovery mechanisms, health monitoring, and resilience features needed for production environments.

**Evidence**: From previous testing - services could fail without proper recovery, no health monitoring, limited error handling, and no automatic recovery mechanisms.

### **üîß Solution Implemented**

**1. Comprehensive Health Monitoring System**
- **Multi-Method Health Checks**: Process, port, and HTTP endpoint validation
- **Rate-Limited Monitoring**: 30-second intervals to prevent resource overload
- **Health Metrics Tracking**: Uptime, failure counts, recovery attempts, status history

**2. Enhanced Error Recovery Mechanisms**
- **Failure Recording**: Track consecutive failures per service
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic service restart on failure detection
- **Recovery Limits**: Configurable max recovery attempts (default: 3)
- **Failure Thresholds**: Disable auto-recovery after 5 consecutive failures

**3. Service Health Tracking**
- **Health Status**: healthy, unhealthy, failed, unknown
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Track service uptime and last check times
- **Failure History**: Record failure timestamps and error messages
- **Recovery Statistics**: Track recovery attempts and success rates

**4. New API Endpoints**
- **`/health`**: Detailed health information for all services
- **Enhanced `/status`**: Now includes health information in status responses
- **Health Data Structure**: Comprehensive health metrics per service

### **üìä Implementation Details**

**Health Monitoring System:**
```python
async def _check_service_health(self, service_id: str) -> bool:
    """Enhanced health check with multiple validation methods"""
    # Method 1: Process check
    # Method 2: Port check  
    # Method 3: HTTP health check (for services with HTTP endpoints)
    # Rate limiting and comprehensive error handling
```

**Auto-Recovery System:**
```python
async def _auto_recover_service(self, service_id: str) -> bool:
    """Attempt automatic recovery of a failed service"""
    # Check auto-recovery settings
    # Stop service gracefully
    # Restart service
    # Track recovery attempts and success
```

**Failure Recording:**
```python
def _record_service_failure(self, service_id: str, error_message: str):
    """Record a service failure for enhanced error recovery"""
    # Track failure count
    # Update health metrics
    # Disable auto-recovery if threshold exceeded
```

**Health Data Structure:**
```python
{
    "status": "healthy|unhealthy|failed|unknown",
    "last_check": timestamp,
    "uptime": seconds,
    "failure_count": 0,
    "recovery_attempts": 0,
    "auto_recovery_enabled": true,
    "max_recovery_attempts": 3,
    "process_healthy": true,
    "port_healthy": true,
    "http_healthy": true
}
```

### **üöÄ Benefits Achieved**
