# MediVote Single Blockchain Node - Frontend Update Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Service Manager Configuration**
- Removed `blockchain_node_2` from service configurations
- Renamed `blockchain_node_1` to simply `blockchain_node`
- Updated all port references and service names

### 2. **Test Files Updated**
- `test_health_monitoring_slow.py` - Updated expected services list
- `test_blockchain_stop.py` - Removed tests for node 2, renamed node 1

### 3. **Demo Files Clarified**
- `demo_decentralized_network.py` - Added warnings that nodes should run on separate machines in production
- Updated config file names to use `demo_` prefix to distinguish from production

### 4. **Dashboard Updates**
- `blockchain_node_dashboard.py` - Added note about decentralized deployment
- Clarified that the dashboard manages a single local node

## üìã Frontend Status

The frontend JavaScript files (`frontend/js/`) don't contain hardcoded references to "Node 1" or "Node 2". They dynamically display:
- Blockchain status (connected/synchronized)
- Node information from the incentive system
- Network statistics from the dashboard

## üîç No Changes Needed In:

- `frontend/js/main.js` - Uses generic "Blockchain" status
- `frontend/js/admin.js` - Shows "Blockchain" component status
- `frontend/incentive_integration.js` - Handles dynamic node registration
- `network_dashboard.py` - Displays all nodes in the network dynamically

## üöÄ Result

The system now:
1. **Runs a single blockchain node** on development machines
2. **Clearly indicates** that production deployments should use separate machines
3. **Maintains compatibility** with multi-node networks when properly deployed
4. **Simplifies development** with fewer resource requirements

## üìå Key Points

- **Development**: Run 1 node per PC
- **Production**: Run nodes on separate machines
- **Network**: Nodes automatically discover and connect to each other
- **Dashboard**: Shows all nodes in the network, not just local ones
