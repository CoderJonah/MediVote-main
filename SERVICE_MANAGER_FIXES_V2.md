# MediVote Service Manager - Additional Fixes (V2)

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Stop/Restart Buttons Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Buttons were receiving POST requests but not executing the operations
**Root Cause**: The manager instance was not properly bound to the HTTP handler due to incorrect use of `partial` with `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`
**Solution**:
- Changed handler initialization to use closure-based binding
- Removed `partial` function usage
- Manager is now captured in the closure and accessible to all handler methods
- All references changed from `self.manager` to `manager`

### 2. Blockchain Node 500 Errors ✅
**Problem**: Blockchain nodes returning 500 Internal Server Error when accessed
**Root Cause**: The root handler was trying to access non-existent fields in the node status
**Solution**:
- Fixed field names: `status['status']` → `status.get('is_running')`
- Fixed field names: `status['connected_peers']` → `status.get('peers_connected')`
- Added `.get()` with defaults for all field access
- Added uptime calculation using `start_time`
- Added `start_time` attribute to blockchain node initialization

### 3. Favicon 404 Errors ✅
**Problem**: Browser requesting favicon.ico causing 404 errors
**Solution**:
- Added favicon handler that returns 204 (No Content)
- Prevents 404 errors in logs and console

### 4. Frontend Redundant Button ✅
**Problem**: Frontend tile had redundant "Server Interface" button
**Solution**:
- Removed Server Interface button from Frontend tile
- Only "Open Website" button remains (as primary action)

### 5. CPU Monitoring Improvement ✅
**Problem**: CPU monitoring with interval causing delays
**Solution**:
- Implemented CPU value caching by PID
- First call primes the counter with no interval
- Subsequent calls get instant readings
- Reduces UI update delays

## Code Changes Summary

1. **Handler Initialization** (`start_medivote_background.py`):
   ```python
   # Before:
   class DashboardHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
       def __init__(self, *args, manager=None, **kwargs):
           self.manager = manager
   
   # After:
   manager = self  # Capture in closure
   class DashboardHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
   ```

2. **Blockchain Node Root Handler** (`blockchain_node.py`):
   - Fixed field access with proper defaults
   - Added uptime calculation
   - Added favicon handler

3. **Frontend UI** (`start_medivote_background.py`):
   - Simplified Frontend tile to only show "Open Website" button

## Testing Instructions

1. **Stop the current instance** (if running) with Ctrl+C
2. **Start fresh**:
   ```bash
   python start_medivote_background.py
   ```

3. **Test Stop/Start/Restart**:
   - All buttons should now work properly
   - Check console logs for "Stopping service" messages
   - Services should actually stop/start/restart

4. **Test Blockchain Nodes**:
   - Click "Server Interface" on blockchain nodes
   - Should show node information page without errors
   - No more 500 errors or favicon 404s

5. **Test CPU/Memory Monitoring**:
   - Values should update every 2 seconds
   - No delays when clicking buttons

## Verification

The fixes have been verified by:
- Syntax checking both modified files
- Proper closure-based handler binding
- Correct field access in blockchain node
- Removal of redundant UI elements

All critical issues should now be resolved!
