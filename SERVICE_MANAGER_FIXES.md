# MediVote Service Manager - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Button Handler Issues (Stop/Restart not working)
**Problem**: Buttons were not responding after clicks, operations timing out
**Solution**:
- Added timeouts to re-enable buttons after operations complete
- Added proper error handling for async operations
- Fixed button state management in `updateServiceStatus()` to always re-enable buttons
- Added manual refresh after operations to ensure UI updates

### 2. UI/UX Issues
**Network Dashboard Tile**:
- Removed "Dashboard" port display (not applicable)
- Changed "Server Interface" button to "Open Dashboard" as primary action
- No separate dashboard needed for this service

**Frontend Tile**:
- Separated "Server Interface" (points to Backend API on port 8001)
- "Open Website" button remains for accessing the frontend (port 8080)
- Fixed confusion between server interface and website

**General UI**:
- Buttons now properly show "Start" when service is stopped
- Status icons (● for running, ○ for stopped) update correctly

### 3. Blockchain Node Issues
**Problem**: Nodes on ports 8546 and 8547 were not accessible
**Solution**:
- Fixed node configuration generation with correct port mappings
- Added `http_port` and `enable_http` flags to node configs
- Added root HTML endpoint to blockchain nodes for browser access
- Created data directories automatically
- Updated bootstrap nodes to use localhost instead of external domains

### 4. CPU/Memory Monitoring
**Problem**: CPU and Memory values showing as "-"
**Solution**:
- Added `interval=0.1` parameter to `cpu_percent()` calls
- Added proper error handling with fallback values
- Fixed both process-based and port-based monitoring

### 5. CSP (Content Security Policy) Error
**Problem**: Browser warning about eval() being blocked
**Solution**:
- CSP header was already removed from the code
- The "click handler took X ms" warnings were due to slow operations, not CSP
- Fixed by improving async operation handling

## Testing the Fixes

To test the fixes:

1. **Start the Service Manager**:
   ```bash
   python start_medivote_background.py
   ```

2. **Access the Management Dashboard**:
   - Open http://localhost:8090
   - All services should start as "Stopped" with "Start" buttons

3. **Test Button Functions**:
   - Click "Start" on any service - button should disable, show "Starting...", then re-enable
   - Click "Stop" on running service - should show warning, then stop properly
   - Click "Restart" - should restart the service

4. **Test Blockchain Nodes**:
   - Click "Server Interface" on Blockchain Node tiles
   - Should open http://localhost:8546 and http://localhost:8547
   - Both should show node information pages

5. **Test Network Dashboard**:
   - Click "Open Dashboard" button (primary button)
   - Should open http://localhost:8084

6. **Test Frontend**:
   - "Server Interface" → opens Backend API (http://localhost:8001)
   - "Open Website" → opens Frontend (http://localhost:8080)

7. **Monitor CPU/Memory**:
   - Values should update every 2 seconds via Server-Sent Events
   - Should show actual percentages and MB values

## Known Limitations

1. **CPU Monitoring**: First reading might be 0% due to psutil behavior
2. **Service Detection**: If services are started outside the manager, they'll be detected by port scanning
3. **Credibility Warnings**: Still shown when stopping blockchain nodes (by design)

## Future Improvements

1. Add service health checks beyond port availability
2. Implement service log viewing in dashboards
3. Add batch operations (start all, stop all)
4. Persist service states between manager restarts
