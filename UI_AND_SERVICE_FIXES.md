# MediVote Service Manager - UI and Service Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **UI Titles Disappearing**
**Problem**: Service card titles would disappear when the status was updated because the JavaScript was only updating the icon text node and not preserving the service name.

**Solution**: Modified `updateServiceStatus` function to properly preserve the service name when updating the icon:
```javascript
// Get the service name from the h3 text content
const currentText = h3.textContent;
const serviceName = currentText.replace(/^[●○]\s*/, ''); // Remove existing icon

// Update with new icon and preserved name
const newIcon = serviceData.status === 'running' ? '● ' : '○ ';
h3.textContent = newIcon + serviceName;
```

### 2. ✅ **Blockchain Node 2 Giving 404 Error**
**Problem**: Blockchain Node 2 was not properly starting its RPC server on port 8547, even though logs indicated it was started.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the RPC server startup by storing the task reference to prevent garbage collection
- Added error handling to the RPC server startup

```python
# Store RPC task reference to prevent garbage collection
self.rpc_task = asyncio.create_task(self._start_rpc_server())

# Added try-except block around RPC server startup
try:
    # RPC server code...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to start RPC server: {e}")
    raise
```

### 3. ✅ **Backend Service Not Stopping**
**Problem**: Backend service couldn't be stopped gracefully because it was missing a `/shutdown` endpoint.

**Solution**: Added a graceful shutdown endpoint to the backend:
```python
@app.post("/shutdown")
async def shutdown():
    """Graceful shutdown endpoint"""
    import signal
    import os
    
    async def shutdown_server():
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Small delay to send response
        os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGTERM)
    
    asyncio.create_task(shutdown_server())
    
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Server shutting down gracefully"
    }
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **UI Titles**: 
   - Refresh the service manager dashboard
   - Service names should now persist when status updates

2. **Blockchain Node 2**:
   - Restart blockchain_node_2 through the service manager
   - Access http://localhost:8547 should now work

3. **Backend Stopping**:
   - Click Stop on the backend service
   - Should now stop gracefully instead of timing out

## Additional Improvements

- Added better error handling for port conflicts in backend startup
- Improved RPC server reliability for blockchain nodes
- Enhanced graceful shutdown for all services

## Next Steps

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the logs in the `logs/` directory
2. Ensure no other processes are using the required ports
3. Try restarting the service manager if needed
